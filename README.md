The Sentiment Analysis Tool allows you to analyze the sentiment of individual reviews or text inputs effortlessly. Using the power of natural language processing (NLP), this tool evaluates the sentiment behind a piece of text and provides a comprehensive sentiment analysis. Hereâ€™s how it works:

How It Works
Input Text: Enter the text you want to analyze in the provided text area.
Analyze Sentiment: Click the "Enter" button to process the text.
Sentiment Results:
Polarity: A value between -1 and 1, indicating how negative or positive the text is. A negative score indicates negative sentiment, a positive score indicates positive sentiment, and a score around zero indicates neutral sentiment.
Subjectivity: A value between 0 and 1 that tells how subjective or objective the text is. A score closer to 1 indicates a subjective statement (opinion), while a score closer to 0 indicates an objective statement (fact).
